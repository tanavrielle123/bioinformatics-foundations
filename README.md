# bioinformatics-foundations

This repository documents my learning and practice in basic bioinformatics analysis.

The focus of this repository is on understanding biological data, performing basic analysis, and interpreting results in a biological context.

## Focus areas
- Gene expression data
- Basic data cleaning and normalisation
- Visualisation (PCA, heatmaps)
- Biological interpretation of results

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter notebooks
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

This repository is intended as a learning portfolio rather than a production bioinformatics tool.
