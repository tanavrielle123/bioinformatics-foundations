# bioinformatics-foundations
Learning-focused bioinformatics analyses using real biological data, with emphasis on gene expression, visualisation, and biological interpretation.

# Bioinformatics Foundations
This repository documents my learning and practice in basic bioinformatics analysis.

## Focus areas
- Gene expression data
- Basic data cleaning and normalisation
- Visualisation (PCA, heatmaps)
- Biological interpretation of results

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter notebooks
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

This repository is intended as a learning portfolio rather than a production bioinformatics tool.
